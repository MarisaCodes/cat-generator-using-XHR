# cat-generator-using-XHR

- Cats are pulled from another dimension using XMLhttpRequest.
- If a cat is already on display it gets banished into a different dimension when you click generate and another cat takes its place.
- This is just practice because I found fetch and promises to be a bit confusing.
- I hope I understand fetch soon to reduce the boilerplate :/
